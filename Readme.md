### Shiny Application

**How to run**

Share as two R files

Anyone with R can run my Shiny app. You will need a copy of my server.R and ui.R files, as well as any supplementary materials used in my app (here:.nojekyll). Place the files into an app directory in your working directory. 

You can launch the app in R with the following commands:

* install.packages(“shiny”)
* library(shiny)
* runApp()

Once the app is running, you do the following:

* Select your investor type
* Fill in your years to retirement
* Provide your current savings amount

You will then hit the "**Submit**" button and your retirement savings will be plotted.
